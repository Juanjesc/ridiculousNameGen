## Why this proyect?
- Well, I like playing video games, especially MMORPGs and I've always had a strange predilection for coming up with random names for my characters that sounded absurd, it often took me a while to think of the right word, so I decided to make my own application to generate them. 
Unfortunately there is no api that generates the names the way I want them (unique words, no special characters, spanish words, and that sound ridiculously cool), so to make this little app, I made a list in an array with more than 100 different words.

<h4>All you have to do is click on the Generate button and you will be shown a random Spanish word for your character in games.</h4>
